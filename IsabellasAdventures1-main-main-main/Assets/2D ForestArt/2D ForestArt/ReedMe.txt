*** 2D ForestArt - Read Me - ***


This is a set of background image and forest elements for 2D games.


== Description ==

Usage is very simple.

Place the background image in the beginning.
Then, place the forest elements.

It looks naturally by changing the size in the same parts.

Since there is a forest element that changed the color to blend into the background image,
please use the forest elements adapted to the background image, respectively.

Background image so that you can create a background image that follows indefinitely, 
combined connects the background image because it is drawn as the left and right edges come together.
This is suitable for the background of the game to move a lot of players. (For example, Flxxpy Bird)
